1. Goal1: better cov matrix, this is what caught my eye https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18717, kinda new [23 Jun 2025], but will try to implement
2. Goal2: better constraints, especially a performance floor 
3. Goal3: better expected returns, (maybe https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18717 will comein handy for that too)
